Here are all the programs from CS 354 Machine Organization.

Program 0 is the intro to C's preprocessing and assembly stages - 
basically passing various parameters to gcc

Program 1 is implementing a linked list. It was created using a TDD methodology
Created the main tester function first, then implemented the linked list struct
and supporting function/methods.

Program 2 was logic puzzles using arithmetic (shifting bits, and other
 basic primitive type manipulations).

Program 3 is assembly bombs. Disarm the bombs by going into memory and
figuring out from the code, what value I should enter.

Program 4 was creating and implmenting a basic cache.

Program 5 was implementing malloc. That too was created using a TDD
methodology. The idea is to make sure it passes one test before
moving on to the next function. Note: program 5 has a memory leak that I
couldn't fix.

Program 6 was signal handling and processing.
