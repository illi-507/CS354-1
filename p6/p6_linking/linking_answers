Q1
Write the commands you used for performing steps 1, 6 and 11:
 1) gcc -m32 -Wall -std=gnu99 -o prog1.i -E prog1.c
 6) gcc -m32 -Wall -std=gnu99 -o calc.o -c calc.s
11) gcc -m32 -Wall -std=gnu99 -o prog2 prog2.o calc.o


Q2
Necessary steps (among 1~11) to ensure prog2's correctness after changing
calc.c: (Numbers only, not the commands.)

4,5,6,11

Q3
Necessary steps (among 1~11) after changing calc.h: (Numbers only.)
All of them.
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11

Q4
Copy the line you added to prog2.c here:

extern int num_err;

Q5
Yes/No: 
If yes, copy the lines added here:

If no, explain here:
    No, not without changing how num_calc is defined in calc.c.
    num_calc is a static so it is only accessible in the calc.c file,
    and so outside files like prog1 and prog2 cannot access that variable
    unless we change static int num_calc to int num_calc and use extern int
    num_calc in prog1 and prog2.
